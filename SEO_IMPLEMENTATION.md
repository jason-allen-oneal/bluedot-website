## What You Need to Do

### 1. Add Verification Codes
Update `src/app/layout.tsx` with your actual verification codes:

```typescript
verification: {
    google: "your-actual-google-verification-code",  // Get from Google Search Console
    yandex: "your-actual-yandex-verification-code",  // Get from Yandex Webmaster
},
```

**How to get verification codes:**
- Google: https://search.google.com/search-console
- Yandex: https://webmaster.yandex.com/

### 2. Create Open Graph Image
Create a social sharing image at:
- Location: `/public/og-image.png`
- Size: 1200x630 pixels
- Content: Your logo/branding with "bluedot.it.com - Jason O'Neal"

### 3. Create PWA Icons
Create app icons at:
- `/public/icon-192.png` (192x192 pixels)
- `/public/icon-512.png` (512x512 pixels)

Use your bluedot logo and ensure it has a transparent or colored background.

### 4. Set Environment Variable
Add this to your `.env.local` or production environment:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://bluedot.it.com
```

This ensures the sitemap and blog pages work correctly.

Once deployed:
1. Submit sitemap at https://bluedot.it.com/sitemap.xml to:
   - Google Search Console
   - Bing Webmaster Tools
